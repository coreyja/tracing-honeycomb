//! This crate provides:
//! - A tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer`, that can be used to publish trace data to honeycomb.io
//! - Utilities for implementing distributed tracing against the honeycomb.io backend
//!
//! As a tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer` can be composed with other layers to provide stdout logging, filtering, etc.
